# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-19

First complete release of the primitive surface.

### Added

- Per-user supervisor over a Windows named pipe / Unix socket, with autostart, stale-lock
  recovery, graceful shutdown, and a diagnostics log.
- ACP v1 sessions over stdio, one adapter process per session, with `initialize`,
  `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`, and `session/close` when advertised.
- Primitives: `spawn`, `send`, `read`, `wait`, `list`, plus `cancel`, `close`, and `permit`.
- Cursor-addressed event log bounded by count, total bytes, per-event bytes, and per-read
  page bytes, with visible eviction and raw ACP payloads on request.
- One-shot waits on `idle`, `permission`, `exit`, and `change`; timeouts never disturb the
  session.
- Prompt queue with visible depth; `cancel` stops the active turn and discards queued
  messages.
- Permission requests surfaced as orchestration state: default `allow` (auto-answer with a
  recorded `policy:allow`), opt-in `ask`, `deny`, `permit --always` to remove the gate from a
  live session, and provider-native modes through `spawn --mode` and `hlao mode`.
- Identity generated before process start and injected as `HLAO_*` environment variables;
  self-and-descendants visibility enforced by the supervisor.
- Backend manifests as data: built-in Claude and Codex adapters plus user and project
  configuration.
- Human and `--json` output for every command; exit code 2 distinguishes a bounded wait
  timeout.
- Atomic lock writes, verified stale-lock recovery, and a `down --force` that never kills an
  unverified pid.
- Windows hard termination takes the adapter's process tree; a prompt failure clears its
  pending permission instead of leaving a false `waiting_permission`.
- Scripted ACP agent and 62 tests: 28 unit and 34 end-to-end through the real CLI and
  supervisor, including the four acceptance assemblies (cron, kanban, delegation, dynamic
  workflow). Real Claude adapter flow verified end to end on Windows, including automatic and
  `--always` permission answers.

### Design decisions

- ADR 0001: persistent supervisor rather than re-attach per call.
- ADR 0002: bounded in-memory event log, no durable transcript.
- ADR 0003: identity at spawn, no stored lineage.
- ADR 0004: permissions are orchestration state (revised same day: default `allow` after a
  real adapter parked on every tool call; provider modes exposed).
- ADR 0005: one serialized turn; cancel clears the queue.
